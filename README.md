# IIDP
I.T. Infrastructure Documentation Project

The I.T. Infrastructure Documentation Project (IIDP) is designed to provide a template for I.T. personell to document I.T. Infrastructures, hence the name. There is an older project called Network DNA by Don Krause, but since the project appears to have been abandoned, this could be considered to be a fork of that project. Some of the material in this template comes from the original Network DNA project, while other material does not.

NetworkDNA reccomended a seperate document for each seperate location, with redundant copies stored in each location. To me, this is a bit cumbersome. The vision for IIDP is a single document of the entire infrastructure, with redundant copies stored in each location. I also recommend storing a copy in the location of the off-site backups. This one document approach allows for an easier understanding of how all of the pieces fit together into a single coherent infrastructure.

There are still at least a few peices that need to be added to the template, but I believe that the template is in a usable enough state to warrant making it public.

The templates are in Microsoft Word and Excel formats as they are the most widely used. Since Open Office / Libre Office will open MS Office format files, this shouldn't be a major issue.
